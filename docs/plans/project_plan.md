# unittest-to-pytest Migration Tool - Project Plan

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a robust, production-ready tool that automatically migrates Python unittest-based test suites to pytest format while preserving code quality, formatting, and test behavior.

### Goals
- **Primary**: Automate 90%+ of common unittest-to-pytest migration patterns
- **Secondary**: Provide detailed migration reports and manual intervention guidance
- **Tertiary**: Support batch processing of large codebases with minimal human intervention

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish core pipeline architecture and basic transformation capabilities

#### Deliverables
- Core pipeline framework (Job → Task → Step)
- Event bus system for observability
- Result handling with error propagation
- Basic libcst integration
- Simple assertion transformations (assertEqual, assertTrue, etc.)

#### Success Criteria
- Pipeline can process single test files
- Basic assertions are correctly transformed
- Events are properly published and observable
- Error handling prevents pipeline crashes

### Phase 2: Core Transformations (Weeks 4-7)
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive unittest pattern recognition and transformation

#### Deliverables
- Complete intermediate representation (IR) model
- UnittestToIR transformation step
- IRToPytest generation step
- Fixture generation from setUp/tearDown methods
- Class-to-function transformation logic
- Import management and cleanup

#### Success Criteria
- All common unittest patterns are recognized
- IR accurately represents test semantics
- Generated pytest code is syntactically correct
- Fixtures properly handle setup/teardown logic

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 8-10)
**Goal**: Handle complex scenarios and edge cases

#### Deliverables
- Parameterized test support
- Mock integration (unittest.mock → pytest-mock)
- Skip and expectedFailure decorators
- Subtest handling
- Complex inheritance scenarios
- Custom assertion methods

#### Success Criteria
- Complex real-world test suites migrate successfully
- Edge cases are handled gracefully or reported clearly
- Mock transformations maintain test behavior

### Phase 4: Tooling & UX (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal**: Production-ready CLI and user experience with final code formatting

#### Deliverables
- Comprehensive CLI interface
- Configuration file support
- Batch processing capabilities
- Migration reports and analytics
- Dry-run mode with diff preview
- Backup and rollback functionality
- **Final formatter job using isort/black programmatic APIs**
- Integrated import sorting and code formatting
- Formatted output preservation of transformation results

#### Success Criteria
- CLI is intuitive and well-documented
- Batch processing handles large codebases efficiently
- Users can preview changes before applying
- Clear reporting on what was/wasn't migrated
- Generated code is properly formatted using isort and black
- Import statements are consistently sorted
- Code formatting is applied as final pipeline step

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Weeks 13-14)
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and usability

#### Deliverables
- Comprehensive test suite (dogfooding - tests migrate themselves)
- Performance benchmarks
- User documentation and examples
- API documentation
- Migration best practices guide

#### Success Criteria
- Test coverage > 95%
- Performance acceptable for large codebases (>1000 test files)
- Documentation is clear and complete
- Tool successfully migrates its own test suite

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **libcst Learning Curve**: Team unfamiliarity with libcst API
  - *Mitigation*: Dedicated spike week, comprehensive examples
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Infinite variety of unittest patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on 80/20 rule, clear reporting of unsupported patterns

### Medium Risk
- **Performance**: Large codebase processing times
  - *Mitigation*: Parallel processing, incremental updates
- **Code Quality**: Generated code readability
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive formatting preservation, style configuration

### Low Risk
- **Tool Adoption**: Users hesitant to use automated migration
  - *Mitigation*: Excellent dry-run capabilities, conservative defaults

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Transformation Accuracy**: >95% of common patterns correctly transformed
- **Performance**: Process 1000+ test files in <5 minutes
- **Error Rate**: <5% of files require manual intervention
- **Coverage**: Support 90% of unittest patterns found in popular Python projects

### Qualitative
- Generated pytest code passes existing test suites without modification
- Code formatting and style are preserved or improved
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Tool is adopted by development teams for large migrations

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition
- **Senior Developer**: Pipeline architecture, complex transformations
- **Developer**: Basic transformations, testing
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, performance testing, packaging

### Technology Stack
- **Core**: Python 3.10+, libcst, typer (CLI)
- **Testing**: pytest (dogfooding), hypothesis (property testing)
- **Quality**: black, isort, mypy, ruff
- **Packaging**: poetry, GitHub Actions

### Infrastructure
- GitHub repository with comprehensive CI/CD
- Performance testing environment
- Documentation hosting (GitHub Pages)

## Milestones & Timeline

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 3 | Foundation Complete | Working pipeline with basic transformations |
| 7 | Core Features Complete | IR model and comprehensive transformations |
| 10 | Advanced Features Complete | Complex scenario handling |
| 12 | Production Ready | Full CLI and user experience |
| 14 | Release Candidate | Fully tested and documented tool |

## Definition of Done

A migration is considered successful when:
1. All tests in the migrated suite pass without modification
2. Test behavior is preserved (same assertions, same setup/teardown)
3. Code style and formatting are maintained or improved
4. Generated code follows pytest best practices
5. Migration report clearly documents any manual intervention required

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Plugin system for custom transformation rules
- Integration with popular IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm)
- Web interface for visualization and manual intervention
- Support for other testing frameworks (nose, nose2)
- AI-powered edge case handling and pattern recognition
