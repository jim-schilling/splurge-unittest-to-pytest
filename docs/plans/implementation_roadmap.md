## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Every module must include:
- Type annotations for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- Unit tests with >90% coverage
- Error handling for all failure modes
- Integration tests for public APIs
```

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Test pyramid approach:
1. Unit Tests (60%) - Individual functions and classes
2. Integration Tests (30%) - Component interactions  
3. End-to-End Tests (10%) - Full pipeline scenarios
4. Property Tests - Transformation correctness validation
```

### Performance Targets
- Process 1000 test files in under 5 minutes
- Memory usage under 500MB for large codebases
- Single file transformation under 1 second
- Error recovery without pipeline failure

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation for all public interfaces
- Architecture decision records for major choices
- User guides with real-world examples
- Migration troubleshooting guide

This roadmap provides a concrete path from initial setup to production-ready tool, with clear priorities and deliverables for each phase.
