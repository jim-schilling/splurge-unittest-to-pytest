## Key Architecture Principles

### Functional Pipeline Design
- **Jobs** → **Tasks** → **Steps** hierarchy with single responsibilities
- Pure functions with no side effects throughout the pipeline
- Immutable data structures (PipelineContext, Result containers)
- Deterministic transformations for reliable outputs

### Event-Driven Observability
- EventBus for pipeline execution monitoring
- Subscribers for logging, progress reporting, and analytics
- Non-intrusive observation without coupling pipeline logic

### Intermediate Representation
- Language-agnostic semantic model of test structure
- Separation of parsing concerns from generation concerns
- Enables validation and optimization between transformation phases

### Error-Safe Processing
- Comprehensive Result[T] containers with error propagation
- Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting
- Recovery strategies for different error categories

## Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **libcst**: High-fidelity code transformations preserving formatting
- **Python 3.10+**: Modern Python with type annotations
- **typer**: CLI interface with excellent user experience
- **pydantic**: Configuration validation and data modeling

### Development Tools
- **pytest**: Testing framework (dogfooding approach)
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing for transformation correctness
- **black/isort**: Code formatting and import organization
- **mypy**: Static type checking for reliability

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
Core pipeline architecture, event system, and basic transformations

### Phase 2: Core Transformations (Weeks 4-7)  
Intermediate representation, fixture generation, and comprehensive pattern support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 8-10)
Mock integration, parameterized tests, and complex scenario handling

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 11-12)
CLI interface, configuration system, and user experience polish

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: >95% coverage of individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation  
- **Property Tests**: Transformation correctness verification
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking against large codebases
- **Dogfooding**: Tool migrates its own test suite

### Performance Targets
- Process 1000+ test files in under 5 minutes
- Memory usage under 500MB for large codebases
- Single file transformation under 1 second
- Error recovery without pipeline failure

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- **Transformation Accuracy**: >95% of common unittest patterns correctly transformed
- **Performance**: Process large codebases efficiently with parallel processing
- **Error Rate**: <5% of files require manual intervention after migration
- **Pattern Coverage**: Support 90% of unittest patterns in popular Python projects

### Qualitative Goals
- Generated pytest code passes existing test suites without modification
- Code formatting and style are preserved or improved
- Error messages are clear and actionable for manual intervention
- Tool adoption by development teams for production migrations

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **libcst Learning Curve**: Addressed through dedicated spike weeks and comprehensive examples
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Managed through 80/20 rule focus and clear unsupported pattern reporting
- **Performance Concerns**: Mitigated through parallel processing and incremental optimization

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled through clear phase boundaries and success criteria
- **Quality Concerns**: Addressed through comprehensive testing and dogfooding approach
- **Adoption Barriers**: Reduced through excellent dry-run capabilities and conservative defaults

This documentation provides a complete foundation for implementing a production-ready unittest-to-pytest migration tool that follows software engineering best practices while delivering real value to development teams migrating large Python codebases.
