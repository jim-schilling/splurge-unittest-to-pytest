- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. is_active, has_permission).
- Use PascalCase for class, enum, and dataclass names (e.g., DsvReader, CsvWriter, TransformXmlToJson).
- For SQL, prefer lower case column names.
- Prefer upper snake case for constant names.
- Environment variable names MUST use a project prefix [A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*_ (e.g., SPLURGE_DSV_).
- Test module names should mirror the domains associated with the modules, where DOMAINS is a list of the module's domain names.
 - e.g., for a module that has DOMAINS = ['dsv', 'csv'], the test module should be named test_csv_dsv_[SEQUENCE].py, where [SEQUENCE] is a unique identifier for the test module.
